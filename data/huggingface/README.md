# Light Stable Semantics Dataset

## Dataset Description

This dataset contains aerial orthomosaic tiles captured at three different times of day (10:00, 12:00, and 15:00) to develop vision encoders that are semantically stable under varying lighting conditions. The dataset is designed for training computer vision models that can maintain consistent feature representations despite changes in illumination.

### Dataset Summary

- **Purpose**: Training light-stable semantic vision encoders
- **Data Type**: Aerial orthomosaic tiles (RGBA, 1024x1024 pixels)
- **Time Points**: 3 captures per location (morning, noon, afternoon)
- **Coverage**: Lower Partridge area aerial survey
- **Date**: November 7, 2024 (241107)
- **Location**: MPG Ranch, Montana, USA

### Data Structure

Each record contains:
- `image_t0`: Morning image (10:00, time=1000)
- `image_t1`: Noon image (12:00, time=1200)  
- `image_t2`: Afternoon image (15:00, time=1500)
- `idx`: Tile identifier in format `{ROW}_{COL}`

### Data Collection

The orthomosaics were captured using drone surveys with identical geographic bounds but at different times of day to capture varying lighting conditions. All tiles:
- Are 1024x1024 pixels of 1.2cm resolution
- Maintain spatial alignment across time points
- Use consistent geographic coordinates

### Use Cases

This dataset is intended for:
- Training vision encoders robust to lighting changes
- Semantic stability research in computer vision
- Time-invariant feature learning
- Remote sensing applications requiring lighting robustness
